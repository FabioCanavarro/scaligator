### 📌 Scaligator – Kubernetes Autoscaling on Steroids 🚀

Scaligator is an intelligent Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) alternative, built in Rust for speed, resilience, and extensibility.
It dynamically scales workloads based on custom Prometheus metrics, time-based rules, and business-aware logic — going beyond vanilla Kubernetes autoscaling.
## ✅ Why Scaligator?

  - 🔍 More than CPU/Memory: Scale based on Prometheus metrics or any custom metric.

  - 🕐 Time-based scaling: Automatically scale down non-critical environments at night.

  - ⚡ Rust Performance: Lightweight, blazing fast, and built with safety in mind.

  - 🔒 Production-ready: Config-driven, highly observable, and Kubernetes-native.

  - 🌐 HTTP Alerts: React to external triggers for proactive scaling.

## 🔑 Features

   -  ✅ Kubernetes controller for scaling Deployments

   - ✅ Configurable via Config file or Environment variables

   - ✅ Prometheus integration for metric-driven scaling

   - ✅ REST endpoint for handling alert-based triggers

   - ✅ Graceful shutdown & robust logging
